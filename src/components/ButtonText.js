          <h2>Services</h2>
          <p>We want to make OSU's services available to all students. Some services we want to focus on are: improving our textbook lending program within the HSRC, increasing the minimum student wage to 15 dollars an hour, and ultimately employing more students on campus. This would allow for extended hours of operation for a majority of our food services and rec services. </p>

          <h2>Health</h2>
          <p>We want to see OSU thrive and stay healthy throughout this pandemic. In order to do so, we want to make Covid boosters more readily available for students. We would also like to reopen Plagueman pharmacy so that students can receive their medications on campus. Additionally, we want to reduce waitlist times for CAPS-the mental health resource center on campus.</p>

          <h2>Environmental</h2>
          <p>Going into 2022, OSU and other institutions have been making great strides in order to improve our environment. If we were to be elected, we would work with our local and state government to get OSU carbon neutral within the next 10 years. Lastly, we want to continue to reduce paper and plastic use on campus and within the community.</p>

          <h2>Experiences And Accessibility</h2>
          <p>We want to make OSU 4 you, and at the heart of this is your experience as a student. Part of your experience is the ability to access the information you need to excel as a student, so we will first revamp the OSU website to become more user friendly. We are also hoping to bring more life and energy to campus through bringing food carts and other events to places such as the SEC Plaza. We want to see clubs flourish by improving accessibility to registration information, easing requirements for club events, and providing ASOSU resources to improve club outreach on campus.</p>
